		<h2> New York City </h2>
			<p> The centre of the virus release, on black friday 2016 a modified version of the smallpox virus, known as "The Green Poision",
				it was released into the public through contaminated dolalr bills and it very quickly spread through New York. What has happened to
				other parts of the US in currently unkown but Directive 51 of the US goverment was activated to keep the US safe and in turn actiavted The Division
				Agents. 
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> The virus quickly raged through the city dwindling the New York population down to the thousands, the parks that were once used for recreation became 
				mass graves to the countless dead the holes made for their coffins not even filled just marked for quarantine and abandoned. Many people after the initial 
				virus outbreak many people tried to flee the city but the National Guard stepped in to try and contain the infection by blocking routes between the various islands
				of New York and travel outside of the city though no reports have made it into the city about the world outside.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> As a result of the city limits that have been put in place has led to various groups such as rioters and other more organised groups  
				to spring up and fight against remaining Division Agents and Joint Task Force members until they had to pull out of the area now known as
				The Dark Zone.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> The area now known as The Dark Zone was established and is a mark of failure on the JTF and The Divisions first wave.
				As a result of this The Divsion second wave of agents was activated and tasked with takening back the city from 
				the various factions and rouge first wave agents.
