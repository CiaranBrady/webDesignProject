		<h2> The Underground </h2>
			<p> The various subway tunnels and sewer systems were first used by those seeking shelter in the cold winter storms and those brave enough to try escape
				after the national guard cut off the city. Shortly though the Last Man Battalion moved in and began securing exits to the city as well as the other factions
				making strongholds below ground incase anything was to happen to 'their city'.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> However after the second wave of Division agents began to take back the city above the factions had no options but to move the majority of their forces
				down below into the vast network of tunnels hiding from The Division and JTF, however this also gave the advantage of being able to pop up seemingly anywhere. 
				This ability allowed the rikers to move in an bomb a safe area for those who were still suffering from the green poison. During the attack the many innocent lives
				were lost and The Division quickly responded by establishing "The Hub".
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> The Hub was a service station for maintance workers on the New York subway and is connected by one way or another to most of the major mahattan subway lines.
				With the remaining fuctioning trains agents ventured into the underground sewers and subway lines to elminate major threats and supply depots of the various factions.
				The campaign into the underground was sucessful but a snow storm would quickly stop most of the activity on The Division and JTF side allowing the factions to venture above 
				ground once again.
