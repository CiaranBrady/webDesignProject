		<h2> The Dark Zone </h2>
			<p> The Dark Zone is an area running right through central manhattan and a dark memory for the members of The JTF and The Divisions First Wave.
				After The Dark Zone fell most surviving first wave agents went rouge either staying in the dark zone or joining the Last Man Batallion, a private
				military company based in the city.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> More recently second wave agents have been venturing into The Dark Zone looking for specialized gear. However The Dark Zone is dangerous
				air filtration equipment must be worn at all times agents issac systems are limited, along with these dangers first wave rouges and desperate second wave
				agents have been reported to open fire on division agents venturing into The Dark Zone.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> After the Falcon Lost incident involving Division Agents and the Last Man Batallion supply drops with weapons and advanced division technology began to 
				land in The Dark Zone in very regular intervals. Agents have been heading into The Dark Zone to secure these resources which has increased the risk of agents
				going rouge and also losing their lifes to the various threats in The Dark Zone.
			</p>
			<br></br>
			<p> Reports from agents who were tasked with securing antivirals from The Dark Zone made reports that during the blizzard a squad of hostiles appeared at the 
				extraction site wearing division watches as medals and using division tech to engange the agents, fortunatly these "hunters" were defeated but we don't know
				if we will see more of them in the future. 
				The future of The Dark Zone is unkown but the hope is in time it will be re secured by the division and civilians who were evacuated could return to their homes.
